# IoT Health Monitoring System Proposal

## Project Overview
This proposal outlines the development of an IoT-based Health Monitoring System using Rust, designed to monitor patient vital signs (heart rate, body temperature) and send real-time alerts (email/SMS) when readings exceed critical thresholds. A panic button allows patients to trigger emergency notifications. Data is stored on a cloud server (e.g., ThingSpeak) and visualized via a web dashboard. The system leverages Rustâ€™s memory safety and performance for reliable device and server code, targeting completion of a minimum viable product (MVP) within 30 days.

### Objectives
- Develop a Rust-based IoT device to collect heart rate and temperature data.
- Implement a backend server for data processing and storage.
- Enable real-time alerts via email/SMS for critical readings.
- Provide a web dashboard for data visualization.
- Ensure system reliability, security, and scalability using Rust.

### Scope
- **Hardware**: Raspberry Pi Pico (or ESP32), pulse sensor, DS18B20 temperature sensor, panic button.
- **Software**: Rust firmware for device, Rust backend server, MQTT for communication, web dashboard (HTML/CSS/JS or Leptos).
- **Features**:
  - Real-time vital sign monitoring.
  - Threshold-based alerts (email/SMS).
  - Panic button for emergency notifications.
  - Cloud storage and historical data access.
  - Web dashboard for visualization.
- **Constraints**: 30-day timeline, single developer or small team, focus on MVP.

### Justification
Health monitoring is critical due to increasing healthcare demands and busy lifestyles, making regular checkups challenging (). IoT enables continuous monitoring, reducing hospital visits and enabling remote patient tracking. Rust ensures safe, high-performance code for IoT devices and servers, minimizing bugs and crashes in critical applications.[](https://web.iitd.ac.in/~bmz198302/template/project/project_proposal.html)
